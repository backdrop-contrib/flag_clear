# Flag clear

This module provides Views functionality to remove user flags for nodes and other entities. Instead of requiring a user to login and remove the flag, the admin now has the ability to remove the flags as well. This functionality is often useful in user-submission use-cases, where users do not necessarily un-flag the content that are no longer valid (possibly for items or have been processed by administrators who handled flagged content).
